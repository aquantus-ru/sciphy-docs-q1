CHAPTER 1 -- FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

1.1 PHYSICAL QUANTITIES

Physics is the study of the fundamental laws of nature, expressed through the language of mathematics. To describe the physical world, we define "physical quantities" -- properties or attributes of a phenomenon, body, or substance that can be quantified by measurement.

A physical quantity typically consists of a numerical value and a unit. For example, the mass of an electron is approximately 9.11 x 10 to the power of -31 kg. Here, "9.11 x 10 to the power of -31" is the numerical magnitude and "kg" is the unit.

Physical quantities are broadly categorized into two types:
1. Base Quantities: These are fundamental quantities defined by convention and are independent of other quantities. Examples include length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity.
2. Derived Quantities: These are defined in terms of the base quantities. For example, velocity is derived from length divided by time  open parenthesis m divided by s close parenthesis , and force is derived from mass times acceleration  open parenthesis kg  times  m divided by s to the power of 2 close parenthesis .

1.2 UNITS AND DIMENSIONS

To ensure consistency in scientific communication, the International System of Units  open parenthesis SI close parenthesis  is universally adopted. The seven base SI units are:
- Length: meter  open parenthesis m close parenthesis
- Mass: kilogram  open parenthesis kg close parenthesis
- Time: second  open parenthesis s close parenthesis
- Electric Current: ampere  open parenthesis A close parenthesis
- Temperature: kelvin  open parenthesis K close parenthesis
- Amount of Substance: mole  open parenthesis mol close parenthesis
- Luminous Intensity: candela  open parenthesis cd close parenthesis

"Dimensions" refer to the physical nature of a quantity. We denote the dimensions of length, mass, and time as  open bracket L close bracket ,  open bracket M close bracket , and  open bracket T close bracket , respectively. Analysis of dimensions  open parenthesis Dimensional Analysis close parenthesis  is a powerful tool for verifying equations. For an equation to be physically valid, it must be dimensionally homogeneous.

Example:
The period T of a pendulum is given by T  equals  2 times pi  times  sqrt open parenthesis L divided by g close parenthesis .
Dimension of LHS:  open bracket T close bracket
Dimension of RHS: sqrt open parenthesis  open bracket L close bracket   divided by   open parenthesis  open bracket L close bracket  open bracket T close bracket  to the power of -2 close parenthesis  close parenthesis   equals  sqrt open parenthesis  open bracket T close bracket  to the power of 2 close parenthesis   equals   open bracket T close bracket
Since both sides have the dimension of time, the equation is dimensionally consistent.

1.3 SCALARS VS VECTORS

Physical quantities are further classified based on whether they possess directionality.

Scalars:
A scalar quantity is specified completely by a single number  open parenthesis magnitude close parenthesis  with an appropriate unit. It has no direction.
Examples: Mass, time, temperature, energy, electric charge.
Scalars obey the ordinary rules of algebra  open parenthesis e.g., 5 kg  plus  2 kg  equals  7 kg close parenthesis .

Vectors:
A vector quantity has both a magnitude and a direction. It obeys the laws of vector addition  open parenthesis the parallelogram law or triangle law close parenthesis .
Examples: Displacement, velocity, force, momentum, electric field.

Notation:
Vectors are often denoted by boldface type  open parenthesis v close parenthesis  or with an arrow overhead  open parenthesis vec open parenthesis v close parenthesis  close parenthesis . The magnitude is written as  the magnitude of v  or simply v.

Vector Decomposition:
A vector A in 2D space can be resolved into components along the x and y axes:
A  equals  A subscript x  times  i  plus  A subscript y  times  j
where i and j are unit vectors along the x and y axes.
Magnitude:  the magnitude of A   equals  sqrt open parenthesis A subscript x to the power of 2  plus  A subscript y to the power of 2 close parenthesis
Direction: theta  equals  arctan open parenthesis A subscript y  divided by  A subscript x close parenthesis

1.4 MEASUREMENT LIMITS AND UNCERTAINTY

No physical measurement is perfectly precise. Every measurement is subject to "uncertainty," which provides a range of values within which the true value is likely to lie.

Accuracy vs. Precision:
- Accuracy: How close a measurement is to the true or accepted value.
- Precision: How close repeated measurements of the same quantity are to each other  open parenthesis reproducibility close parenthesis .

Types of Errors:
1. Systematic Errors: Predictable biases in measurement  open parenthesis e.g., a zero-offset error in a scale close parenthesis . These affect accuracy.
2. Random Errors: Unpredictable fluctuations in readings  open parenthesis e.g., electronic noise, human reaction time close parenthesis . These affect precision and can be reduced by averaging multiple measurements.

Reporting Uncertainty:
A result is typically reported as: x subscript best  plus or minus  delta subscript x
where x subscript best is the best estimate  open parenthesis often the mean close parenthesis  and delta subscript x is the uncertainty.

Significant Figures:
The number of digits in a reported value indicates the precision of the measurement. When performing calculations:
- Multiplication divided by Division: The result should have the same number of significant figures as the term with the fewest significant figures.
- Addition divided by Subtraction: The result should have the same number of decimal places as the term with the fewest decimal places.

1.5 MODELS VS REALITY

Physics relies on "models" -- simplified representations of complex physical systems. A model abstracts away negligible details to make a problem solvable while retaining the essential physics.

Examples of Idealizations:
- Point Particle: Treating an object as having mass but zero volume to ignore rotation or internal structure.
- Ideal Gas: Assuming gas particles do not interact and occupy no volume.
- Frictionless Surface: Ignoring resistive forces to simplify the study of motion.

Validity of Models:
A model is only valid within a specific regime. Classical mechanics, for instance, is an excellent model for macroscopic objects moving at slow speeds. However, it fails at atomic scales  open parenthesis requiring Quantum Mechanics close parenthesis  or at speeds approaching the speed of light  open parenthesis requiring Relativistic Mechanics close parenthesis . Understanding the "limits of validity" is crucial for any physicist.

CHAPTER 2 -- CLASSICAL MOTION  open parenthesis KINEMATICS close parenthesis

Kinematics is the branch of mechanics that describes the motion of objects without reference to the forces that cause the motion. It focuses on the geometric aspects of motion: position, velocity, and acceleration.

2.1 POSITION AND DISPLACEMENT

Position:
The position of a particle is its location relative to a chosen reference point  open parenthesis the origin close parenthesis  in a coordinate system. In one dimension  open parenthesis 1D close parenthesis , position is denoted by x open parenthesis t close parenthesis .

Displacement:
Displacement is the change in position of an object. It is a vector quantity, pointing from the initial position to the final position.
Delta subscript x  equals  x subscript final - x subscript initial

Distance vs. Displacement:
- Distance is a scalar representing the total path length traveled.
- Displacement depends only on the endpoints.
For example, if a particle moves from x equals 0 to x equals 10 and back to x equals 0:
Distance  equals  20 units
Displacement  equals  0 units

2.2 VELOCITY AND ACCELERATION

Velocity:
Average velocity is the rate of change of displacement over a time interval.
v subscript avg  equals  Delta subscript x  divided by  Delta subscript t

Instantaneous velocity is the limit of average velocity as the time interval approaches zero. It is the derivative of position with respect to time.
v open parenthesis t close parenthesis   equals  dx open parenthesis t close parenthesis   divided by  dt

Speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector. Average speed is total distance divided by total time.

Acceleration:
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.
Average acceleration: a subscript avg  equals  Delta subscript v  divided by  Delta subscript t
Instantaneous acceleration: a open parenthesis t close parenthesis   equals  dv open parenthesis t close parenthesis   divided by  dt  equals  d to the power of 2x open parenthesis t close parenthesis   divided by  dt to the power of 2

Equations of Motion  open parenthesis Constant Acceleration close parenthesis :
For an object moving with constant acceleration 'a'  open parenthesis e.g., free fall near Earth's surface close parenthesis , the kinematic equations are:
1. v  equals  v subscript 0  plus  a  times  t
2. x  equals  x subscript 0  plus  v subscript 0  times  t  plus  0.5  times  a  times  t to the power of 2
3. v to the power of 2  equals  v subscript 0 to the power of 2  plus  2  times  a  times   open parenthesis x - x subscript 0 close parenthesis
4. x - x subscript 0  equals  0.5  times   open parenthesis v subscript 0  plus  v close parenthesis   times  t

2.3 REFERENCE FRAMES

Motion is relative. To describe the position or velocity of an object, we must define a "frame of reference" -- a coordinate system attached to an observer.

Inertial Reference Frame:
An inertial frame is one in which Newton's First Law holds true  open parenthesis an object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant velocity, unless acted upon by a net external force close parenthesis .
- Any frame moving at a constant velocity relative to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame.
- Accelerating frames  open parenthesis e.g., a rotating carousel close parenthesis  are non-inertial. In non-inertial frames, "fictitious forces"  open parenthesis like centrifugal force close parenthesis  appear to account for the acceleration of the frame itself.

2.4 RELATIVE MOTION

When two observers move relative to each other, they measure different velocities for the same object.

Galilean Transformation  open parenthesis 1D close parenthesis :
Let frame S be fixed, and frame S' move with constant velocity v subscript rel relative to S.
If a particle has velocity u in frame S and velocity u' in frame S':
u  equals  u'  plus  v subscript rel
or
u'  equals  u - v subscript rel

This simple addition of velocities is valid for speeds much slower than the speed of light  open parenthesis c close parenthesis . As speeds approach c, the Galilean transformation must be replaced by the Lorentz transformation of Special Relativity.

Relative Motion in 2D divided by 3D:
For vectors:
v subscript AC  equals  v subscript AB  plus  v subscript BC
This reads: The velocity of A relative to C is the velocity of A relative to B plus the velocity of B relative to C.
Example: A boat crossing a river.
v subscript boat subscript ground  equals  v subscript boat subscript water  plus  v subscript water subscript ground
The resultant velocity of the boat relative to the ground is the vector sum of its velocity relative to the water and the current's velocity.

Start of Chapter 3

CHAPTER 3 -- FORCES AND CLASSICAL DYNAMICS

Dynamics is the study of forces and their effect on motion. While kinematics describes "how" things move, dynamics explains "why" they move.

3.1 NEWTON'S LAWS OF MOTION

Sir Isaac Newton formulated three fundamental laws that form the foundation of classical mechanics.

Newton's First Law  open parenthesis Law of Inertia close parenthesis :
A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant velocity in a straight line, unless acted upon by a net external force.
This implies that force is not required to maintain motion, but rather to change it.

Newton's Second Law  open parenthesis Fundamental Law of Dynamics close parenthesis :
The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the net force applied to it.
F subscript net  equals  dp  divided by  dt
Since momentum p  equals  m  times  v, for a system with constant mass, this simplifies to:
F subscript net  equals  m  times  a
where F subscript net is the vector sum of all forces, m is mass, and a is acceleration.
This equation defines the unit of force, the Newton  open parenthesis N close parenthesis . 1 N  equals  1 kg  times  m divided by s to the power of 2.

Newton's Third Law  open parenthesis Action-Reaction close parenthesis :
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
If object A exerts a force F subscript AB on object B, then object B exerts a force F subscript BA on object A such that:
F subscript AB  equals  - F subscript BA
These forces always act on different objects and therefore never cancel each other out in the context of a single object's free-body diagram.

3.2 FORCE FIELDS

Forces can be contact forces  open parenthesis e.g., friction, tension, normal force close parenthesis  or field forces  open parenthesis action-at-a-distance close parenthesis . A "field" permeates space and exerts a force on a particle situated within it.

Gravitational Field:
Any object with mass creates a gravitational field g around it. Another mass m placed in this field experiences a force F subscript g  equals  m  times  g.
Near Earth's surface, g approx 9.8 m divided by s to the power of 2, pointing distinctively downward.

Electromagnetic Fields:
Electric charges create electric fields, and moving charges create magnetic fields. These fields mediate the electromagnetic interaction.

The concept of fields eliminates the problem of instantaneous action-at-a-distance, suggesting that changes in the source propagate through the field at a finite speed  open parenthesis the speed of light close parenthesis .

3.3 MASS VS WEIGHT

In everyday language, mass and weight are often used interchangeably, but in physics, they are distinct.

Mass  open parenthesis m close parenthesis :
- A scalar quantity representing the amount of matter in an object.
- It is a measure of inertia  open parenthesis resistance to acceleration close parenthesis .
- Mass is intrinsic; it does not change regardless of location  open parenthesis Earth, Moon, space close parenthesis .

Weight  open parenthesis W close parenthesis :
- A vector quantity representing the gravitational force acting on an object.
- W  equals  m  times  g
- Weight depends on the local gravitational field strength. An astronaut weighs less on the Moon than on Earth, but their mass remains the same.

3.4 INERTIA

Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion. It is directly quantifying by mass.
- A massive truck has high inertia: it is hard to start moving and hard to stop.
- A ping-pong ball has low inertia: it is easy to accelerate or decelerate.

The equivalence of "inertial mass"  open parenthesis the m in F equals ma close parenthesis  and "gravitational mass"  open parenthesis the m in F subscript g equals mg close parenthesis  is a deep principle in physics  open parenthesis the Equivalence Principle close parenthesis  that led Einstein to the General Theory of Relativity.

3.5 ACTION-REACTION PAIRS

Identifying correct action-reaction pairs is crucial for solving mechanics problems.

Example: A book resting on a table.
Forces on the book:
1. Gravity  open parenthesis Earth pulling down close parenthesis : W
2. Normal force  open parenthesis Table pushing up close parenthesis : N
Since the book is at rest, N  equals  W  open parenthesis in magnitude close parenthesis .
However, N and W are NOT an action-reaction pair because they act on the same object  open parenthesis the book close parenthesis .

The Action-Reaction pairs are:
- Pair 1: Earth pulls Book down  open parenthesis Gravity close parenthesis   is less than -- is greater than  Book pulls Earth up  open parenthesis Gravity close parenthesis .
- Pair 2: Book pushes Table down  open parenthesis Contact close parenthesis   is less than -- is greater than  Table pushes Book up  open parenthesis Normal Force close parenthesis .

CHAPTER 4 -- ENERGY, WORK, AND CONSERVATION

Energy is a scalar quantity associated with the state of a system. It is one of the most abstract yet useful concepts in physics because of the principle of conservation.

4.1 KINETIC AND POTENTIAL ENERGY

Kinetic Energy  open parenthesis K close parenthesis :
The energy possessed by an object due to its motion.
K  equals  0.5  times  m  times  v to the power of 2
- K is always non-negative.
- Work is required to accelerate a mass from rest to velocity v, and this work is stored as kinetic energy.

Potential Energy  open parenthesis U close parenthesis :
The energy stored in a system due to the configuration or position of its parts. It is associated with conservative forces  open parenthesis like gravity or spring forces close parenthesis .
- Gravitational Potential Energy  open parenthesis near Earth close parenthesis : U subscript g  equals  m  times  g  times  h  open parenthesis where h is height relative to a reference close parenthesis .
- Elastic Potential Energy  open parenthesis spring close parenthesis : U subscript s  equals  0.5  times  k  times  x to the power of 2  open parenthesis where k is the spring constant and x is displacement from equilibrium close parenthesis .

4.2 WORK

Work  open parenthesis W close parenthesis  is the energy transferred to or from an object via the application of force along a displacement.
W  equals  Integral open parenthesis  F dot dx  close parenthesis
For a constant force F applied over a displacement d:
W  equals  F  times  d  times  cos open parenthesis theta close parenthesis
where theta is the angle between the force vector and the displacement vector.

- Work is positive if force aids motion.
- Work is negative if force opposes motion  open parenthesis e.g., friction close parenthesis .
- Work is zero if force is perpendicular to motion  open parenthesis e.g., centripetal force close parenthesis .

Work-Energy Theorem:
The net work done on an object equals the change in its kinetic energy.
W subscript net  equals  Delta subscript K  equals  K subscript final - K subscript initial

4.3 POWER

Power  open parenthesis P close parenthesis  is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred.
P  equals  dW  divided by  dt
For a constant force moving an object at velocity v:
P  equals  F dot v
The SI unit of power is the Watt  open parenthesis W close parenthesis . 1 W  equals  1 J divided by s.

4.4 CONSERVATION LAWS

Conservation of Energy:
The total energy of an isolated system remains constant; it is said to be conserved. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.
Delta subscript E subscript system  equals  0

Mechanical Energy Conservation:
If only conservative forces  open parenthesis gravity, spring force close parenthesis  do work within a system, the total mechanical energy  open parenthesis E subscript mech  equals  K  plus  U close parenthesis  is conserved.
K subscript i  plus  U subscript i  equals  K subscript f  plus  U subscript f

If non-conservative forces  open parenthesis like friction close parenthesis  are present, mechanical energy is converted into thermal energy  open parenthesis internal energy close parenthesis .
W subscript nc  equals  Delta subscript E subscript mech  equals   open parenthesis K subscript f  plus  U subscript f close parenthesis  -  open parenthesis K subscript i  plus  U subscript i close parenthesis
where W subscript nc is the work done by non-conservative forces.

Other Conservation Laws:
- Conservation of Linear Momentum: If the net external force on a system is zero, the total linear momentum is conserved.  open parenthesis Crucial for collisions close parenthesis .
- Conservation of Angular Momentum: If the net external torque on a system is zero, the total angular momentum is conserved.  open parenthesis Crucial for rotation close parenthesis .

Start of Chapter 5

CHAPTER 5 -- OSCILLATIONS AND WAVES

Oscillations describe repetitive motion back and forth around an equilibrium position. Waves describe the propagation of a disturbance through space, often transporting energy without transporting matter.

5.1 HARMONIC OSCILLATORS

Simple Harmonic Motion  open parenthesis SHM close parenthesis  occurs when a restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement from equilibrium and acts in the opposite direction.
F  equals  -k  times  x  open parenthesis Hooke's Law close parenthesis
By Newton's second law:
m  times  d to the power of 2x divided by dt to the power of 2  equals  -k  times  x
d to the power of 2x divided by dt to the power of 2  plus   open parenthesis k divided by m close parenthesis   times  x  equals  0

The solution is a sinusoidal function:
x open parenthesis t close parenthesis   equals  A  times  cos open parenthesis omega  times  t  plus  phi close parenthesis
where:
- A is Amplitude  open parenthesis maximum displacement close parenthesis .
- omega is angular frequency  open parenthesis sqrt open parenthesis k divided by m close parenthesis  close parenthesis .
- phi is the phase constant  open parenthesis determined by initial conditions close parenthesis .

5.2 FREQUENCY, WAVELENGTH, PERIOD

Oscillation Parameters:
- Period  open parenthesis T close parenthesis : Time for one complete cycle. T  equals  2 times pi  divided by  omega.
- Frequency  open parenthesis f close parenthesis : Number of cycles per unit time. f  equals  1  divided by  T  equals  omega  divided by   open parenthesis 2 times pi close parenthesis . Unit: Hertz  open parenthesis Hz close parenthesis .

Wave Parameters:
For a traveling wave  open parenthesis e.g., y open parenthesis x,t close parenthesis   equals  A  times  cos open parenthesis k subscript w  times  x - omega  times  t close parenthesis  close parenthesis :
- Wavelength  open parenthesis lambda close parenthesis : The spatial distance between consecutive peaks.
- Wave Number  open parenthesis k subscript w close parenthesis : Spatial frequency. k subscript w  equals  2 times pi  divided by  lambda.
- Wave Speed  open parenthesis v close parenthesis : The speed at which the wave peaks move. v  equals  lambda  times  f  equals  omega  divided by  k subscript w.

5.3 RESONANCE

Resonance is a phenomenon where a system responds with maximum amplitude to an external driving force at a specific frequency, known as the resonant frequency.
- Driven Damped Oscillator: When the driving frequency matches the system's natural frequency  open parenthesis omega subscript 0 close parenthesis , energy transfer is most efficient.
- Examples: Pushing a swing, shattering a glass with sound, tuning a radio circuit.
- If damping is low, the resonance peak is sharp and high. If damping is high, the peak is broad and lower.

5.4 STANDING WAVES

Standing waves are formed by the superposition  open parenthesis interference close parenthesis  of two waves traveling in opposite directions with the same frequency and amplitude. Unlike traveling waves, standing waves do not propagate; they oscillate in place.

Nodes and Antinodes:
- Nodes: Points of zero amplitude  open parenthesis destructive interference close parenthesis .
- Antinodes: Points of maximum amplitude  open parenthesis constructive interference close parenthesis .

Boundary Conditions:
- String fixed at both ends: Length L must be an integer multiple of half-wavelengths.
  L  equals  n  times   open parenthesis lambda  divided by  2 close parenthesis , where n  equals  1, 2, 3...
  Allowed frequencies: f subscript n  equals  n  times   open parenthesis v  divided by  2L close parenthesis .
  These discrete frequencies are called harmonics or overtones.
- Open divided by Closed Pipes: Similar rules apply to sound waves in tubes, depending on whether the ends are open  open parenthesis pressure node close parenthesis  or closed  open parenthesis pressure antinode close parenthesis .

CHAPTER 6 -- CLASSICAL ELECTROMAGNETISM

Electromagnetism describes the interaction of charged particles via electric and magnetic fields. It unifies electricity, magnetism, and optics.

6.1 ELECTRIC FIELDS

Electric Charge  open parenthesis q close parenthesis :
A fundamental property of matter. Charges can be positive or negative. Like charges repel; opposite charges attract. Charge is conserved.

Coulomb's Law:
The force between two point charges q1 and q2 separated by distance r is:
F  equals  k subscript e  times   open parenthesis q1  times  q2 close parenthesis   divided by  r to the power of 2
where k subscript e is Coulomb's constant.

Electric Field  open parenthesis E close parenthesis :
Defined as the force per unit charge.
E  equals  F  divided by  q
A point charge q produces a field:
E  equals  k subscript e  times  q  divided by  r to the power of 2  times  r subscript hat
Field lines point away from positive charges and towards negative charges.

6.2 MAGNETIC FIELDS

Magnetic fields  open parenthesis B close parenthesis  are produced by moving electric charges  open parenthesis currents close parenthesis  or intrinsic magnetic moments  open parenthesis spin close parenthesis .
- Permanent magnets have North and South poles. Field lines run from North to South outside the magnet.
- No magnetic monopoles have ever been observed  open parenthesis Gauss's Law for Magnetism close parenthesis .

6.3 LORENTZ FORCE

A charged particle q moving with velocity v in the presence of both an electric field E and a magnetic field B experiences the Lorentz Force:
F  equals  q  times   open parenthesis E  plus  v x B close parenthesis
- The electric force  open parenthesis qE close parenthesis  is parallel to the field.
- The magnetic force  open parenthesis q open parenthesis v x B close parenthesis  close parenthesis  is perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field.
- Magnetic forces do no work on charged particles because the force is always perpendicular to the displacement.

6.4 MAXWELL'S EQUATIONS

James Clerk Maxwell synthesized the laws of electricity and magnetism into four partial differential equations.

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity:
   Div open parenthesis E close parenthesis   equals  rho  divided by  epsilon subscript 0

    open parenthesis Magnetic fields are generated by currents J and by changing electric fields close parenthesis .

6.5 EM WAVES

Maxwell's equations predict that oscillating electric and magnetic fields sustain each other and propagate through space as a wave.
- The wave equation derived from Maxwell's equations shows that these waves travel at a speed c  equals  1  divided by  sqrt open parenthesis mu subscript 0  times  epsilon subscript 0 close parenthesis .
- This value matched the measured speed of light, leading Maxwell to conclude that light is an electromagnetic wave.

CHAPTER 7 -- MATTER, ATOMS, AND ISOTOPES

This chapter transitions from the macroscopic classical world to the microscopic structure of matter.

7.1 ATOMIC STRUCTURE

Matter is composed of atoms. An atom consists of a dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged electrons.
- The size of an atom is roughly 1 Angstrom  open parenthesis 10 to the power of -10 m close parenthesis .
- The nucleus is much smaller, roughly 1 femtometer  open parenthesis 10 to the power of -15 m close parenthesis , yet contains over 99.9 percent  of the mass.

Bohr Model  open parenthesis Historical close parenthesis :
Proposed electrons orbit the nucleus in discrete energy levels. While superseded by quantum mechanics  open parenthesis electron clouds divided by orbitals close parenthesis , it provides a useful heuristic for energy levels.

7.2 PROTONS, NEUTRONS, ELECTRONS

The three primary subatomic particles are:
1. Proton  open parenthesis p close parenthesis :
   - Charge:  plus e  open parenthesis  plus 1.602 x 10 to the power of -19 C close parenthesis
   - Mass: approx 1.673 x 10 to the power of -27 kg  open parenthesis approx 1836 times electron mass close parenthesis .
   - Located in the nucleus.
2. Neutron  open parenthesis n close parenthesis :
   - Charge: 0  open parenthesis neutral close parenthesis
   - Mass: approx 1.675 x 10 to the power of -27 kg  open parenthesis slightly heavier than proton close parenthesis .
   - Located in the nucleus.
3. Electron  open parenthesis e- close parenthesis :
   - Charge: -e  open parenthesis -1.602 x 10 to the power of -19 C close parenthesis
   - Mass: approx 9.11 x 10 to the power of -31 kg.
   - Located in orbitals around the nucleus.

Atomic Number  open parenthesis Z close parenthesis : Number of protons. Determines the element identity.
Mass Number  open parenthesis A close parenthesis : Total number of protons and neutrons  open parenthesis nucleons close parenthesis . A  equals  Z  plus  N.

7.3 ISOTOPES

Isotopes are variants of a chemical element that have the same number of protons  open parenthesis Z close parenthesis  but a different number of neutrons  open parenthesis N close parenthesis .
- Because they have the same electron configuration, isotopes behave almost identically chemically.
- Their physical properties  open parenthesis mass, stability, magnetic spin close parenthesis  differ.

Notation:
 to the power of A subscript Z X
Example: Carbon-12  open parenthesis  to the power of 12 subscript 6 C close parenthesis  has 6 protons, 6 neutrons. Carbon-14  open parenthesis  to the power of 14 subscript 6 C close parenthesis  has 6 protons, 8 neutrons.

7.4 NUCLEAR BINDING

Protons in the nucleus repel each other electrostatically. The nucleus is held together by the "Strong Nuclear Force," which is attractive and much stronger than the electric force at short ranges  open parenthesis few femtometers close parenthesis .

Binding Energy:
The energy required to disassemble a nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons.
It is the energy equivalent of the "mass defect."

7.5 MASS DEFECT

The mass of a stable nucleus is always  times less times  than the sum of the masses of its constituent nucleons.
Delta subscript m  equals   open parenthesis Z  times  m subscript proton  plus  N  times  m subscript neutron close parenthesis  - m subscript nucleus

This "missing mass" is converted into binding energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence:
E subscript binding  equals  Delta subscript m  times  c to the power of 2

High binding energy per nucleon indicates a stable nucleus. Iron-56  open parenthesis  to the power of 56Fe close parenthesis  has one of the highest binding energies per nucleon, making it the most stable configuration. Fusion releases energy for light elements  open parenthesis up to Iron close parenthesis , while fission releases energy for heavy elements  open parenthesis heavier than Iron close parenthesis .

Start of Chapter 8

CHAPTER 8 -- NUCLEAR PHYSICS

Nuclear physics studies the interactions and structure of atomic nuclei.

8.1 NUCLEAR FORCES

The Strong Interaction  open parenthesis Strong Force close parenthesis  binds quarks together to form protons and neutrons, and binds protons and neutrons together to form nuclei.
- Range: Very short  open parenthesis  approximately 1-3 fm close parenthesis .
- Strength: Roughly 137 times stronger than electromagnetism.
- It overcomes the Coulomb repulsion between protons.

The Weak Interaction is responsible for radioactive decay  open parenthesis like beta decay close parenthesis  and neutrino interactions.
- Range: Extremely short  open parenthesis sub-nuclear close parenthesis .

8.2 STABLE VS UNSTABLE NUCLEI

Plotting Neutron number  open parenthesis N close parenthesis  vs Proton number  open parenthesis Z close parenthesis  creates the "Valley of Stability."
- For light nuclei  open parenthesis Z  is less than  20 close parenthesis , stable nuclei have N approx Z.
- For heavier nuclei, more neutrons are needed to screen the proton repulsion, so N  is greater than  Z.
- Nuclei outside this stability band are unstable and decay to reach a more stable configuration.

8.3 RADIOACTIVE DECAY

Unstable nuclei spontaneously transform into different nuclei, emitting radiation in the process. This is a random, probabilistic process.

Law of Radioactive Decay:
The rate of decay is proportional to the number of radioactive nuclei present.
dN  divided by  dt  equals  -lambda  times  N
Solution:
N open parenthesis t close parenthesis   equals  N subscript 0  times  e to the power of  open parenthesis -lambda  times  t close parenthesis
where lambda is the decay constant.

8.4 HALF-LIFE

The half-life  open parenthesis t subscript 1 divided by 2 close parenthesis  is the time required for half of a sample of radioactive nuclei to decay.
t subscript 1 divided by 2  equals  ln open parenthesis 2 close parenthesis   divided by  lambda approx 0.693  divided by  lambda
After n half-lives, the remaining fraction of the original sample is  open parenthesis 1 divided by 2 close parenthesis  to the power of n.

8.5 DECAY MODES

CHAPTER 9 -- NUCLEAR SPIN AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM

This chapter introduces quantum properties essential for understanding phenomena like Magnetic Resonance Imaging  open parenthesis MRI close parenthesis .

9.1 INTRINSIC SPIN

Spin is a fundamental, intrinsic form of angular momentum carried by elementary particles. It is not due to physical rotation in space but is an inherent quantum property.
- Fermions  open parenthesis electrons, protons, neutrons close parenthesis  have half-integer spin  open parenthesis e.g., 1 divided by 2 close parenthesis .
- Bosons  open parenthesis photons close parenthesis  have integer spin.

9.2 ANGULAR MOMENTUM QUANTIZATION

In quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized. The magnitude of the spin angular momentum vector S is given by:
 the magnitude of S   equals  h subscript bar  times  sqrt open parenthesis s  times   open parenthesis s  plus  1 close parenthesis  close parenthesis
where s is the spin quantum number  open parenthesis e.g., 1 divided by 2 close parenthesis  and h subscript bar is the reduced Planck constant  open parenthesis h  divided by  2 times pi close parenthesis .

The component of spin along a chosen axis  open parenthesis usually z close parenthesis  is also quantized:
S subscript z  equals  m subscript s  times  h subscript bar
where m subscript s can take values from -s to  plus s in integer steps.
For a proton  open parenthesis s equals 1 divided by 2 close parenthesis , m subscript s can be  plus 1 divided by 2  open parenthesis "spin up" close parenthesis  or -1 divided by 2  open parenthesis "spin down" close parenthesis .

9.3 SPIN QUANTUM NUMBER  open parenthesis I close parenthesis

For a nucleus, the total angular momentum is the vector sum of the spins and orbital angular momenta of all constituent nucleons. This total nuclear spin is denoted by I.
- Nuclei with even Z and even N have I  equals  0  open parenthesis e.g.,  to the power of 12C,  to the power of 16O close parenthesis . These are "NMR silent."
- Nuclei with odd mass number A have half-integer spin  open parenthesis e.g.,  to the power of 1H has I equals 1 divided by 2,  to the power of 13C has I equals 1 divided by 2 close parenthesis .
- Nuclei with odd Z and odd N have integer spin  open parenthesis e.g.,  to the power of 2H has I equals 1 close parenthesis .

The value of I determines the number of possible magnetic states  open parenthesis 2I  plus  1 close parenthesis .

9.4 MAGNETIC MOMENT

A particle with spin and charge possesses a magnetic dipole moment  open parenthesis mu close parenthesis . It behaves like a tiny bar magnet.
mu  equals  gamma  times  S
where gamma is the "gyromagnetic ratio," a constant specific to each nucleus.
For a proton: gamma  divided by  2 times pi approx 42.58 MHz divided by T.

The potential energy of a magnetic moment in an external magnetic field B is:
E  equals  - mu dot B
Energy is minimized when the moment aligns with the field. This alignment is the basis for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.

CHAPTER 10 -- QUANTUM MECHANICS FUNDAMENTALS

Quantum mechanics describes the physics of the very small, where classical mechanics fails. It introduces probabilism and wave-particle duality.

10.1 QUANTIZATION

Energy and other physical quantities often exist in discrete "packets" or quanta rather than continuous ranges.
- Planck's Hypothesis: Energy of light is quantized. E  equals  h  times  f.
- Bohr Atom: Angular momentum of electrons is quantized. L  equals  n  times  h subscript bar.

10.2 WAVEFUNCTIONS

The state of a quantum system is fully described by a wavefunction, Psi open parenthesis x, t close parenthesis .
- Psi is a complex-valued function.
- The Born Rule states that the probability density of finding a particle at position x is given by  the magnitude of Psi open parenthesis x, t close parenthesis   to the power of 2  equals  Psi  times  Psi subscript conjugate.
- The total probability of finding the particle somewhere in space must be 1  open parenthesis Normalization close parenthesis .

10.3 OPERATORS

In quantum mechanics, physical observables  open parenthesis position, momentum, energy close parenthesis  are represented by mathematical operators acting on the wavefunction.
- Position operator: x subscript hat  equals  x
- Momentum operator: p subscript hat  equals  -i  times  h subscript bar  times  d divided by dx
- Energy operator  open parenthesis Hamiltonian close parenthesis : H subscript hat

10.4 ENERGY EIGENSTATES

The Schrodinger Equation describes how the wavefunction evolves.
Time-Dependent Schrodinger Equation:
i  times  h subscript bar  times  dPsi divided by dt  equals  H subscript hat  times  Psi

Time-Independent Schrodinger Equation  open parenthesis for stationary states close parenthesis :
H subscript hat  times  psi open parenthesis x close parenthesis   equals  E  times  psi open parenthesis x close parenthesis
Here, psi open parenthesis x close parenthesis  is an eigenfunction  open parenthesis eigenstate close parenthesis  of the Hamiltonian, and E is the corresponding eigenvalue  open parenthesis energy level close parenthesis .
If a system is in an eigenstate, it has a definite energy.

10.5 SELECTION RULES

Transitions between energy levels occur via the absorption or emission of photons. However, not all transitions are allowed. "Selection rules" derived from conservation laws  open parenthesis angular momentum, parity close parenthesis  dictate which transitions are "allowed"  open parenthesis high probability close parenthesis  and which are "forbidden"  open parenthesis low probability close parenthesis .
Example: In electric dipole transitions, the change in orbital angular momentum quantum number  open parenthesis l close parenthesis  must be Delta subscript l  equals   plus or minus  1.

CHAPTER 11 -- MAGNETIC RESONANCE  open parenthesis NMR  divided by  MR close parenthesis

Magnetic Resonance Imaging  open parenthesis MRI close parenthesis  and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance  open parenthesis NMR close parenthesis  spectroscopy exploit the quantum magnetic properties of nuclei, specifically hydrogen  open parenthesis  to the power of 1H close parenthesis  in water and fat.

11.1 MAGNETIC MOMENT INTERACTION WITH B0 FIELD

When a sample containing spins  open parenthesis like protons close parenthesis  is placed in a strong, static magnetic field B subscript 0  open parenthesis conventionally along the z-axis close parenthesis , the magnetic moments align either parallel  open parenthesis low energy close parenthesis  or anti-parallel  open parenthesis high energy close parenthesis  to the field.
This creates a net magnetization vector M subscript 0 pointing along B subscript 0.

11.2 ZEEMAN SPLITTING

In the absence of a magnetic field, the spin states  open parenthesis up and down close parenthesis  are degenerate  open parenthesis have the same energy close parenthesis .
In the presence of B subscript 0, the energy levels split. This is the Zeeman Effect.
Delta subscript E  equals  h subscript bar  times  gamma  times  B subscript 0
The energy gap is proportional to the field strength.

11.3 LARMOR FREQUENCY

The spins do not just align; they precess  open parenthesis wobble close parenthesis  around the B subscript 0 field axis, much like a spinning top in gravity.
The frequency of precession is the Larmor Frequency  open parenthesis omega subscript 0 close parenthesis :
omega subscript 0  equals  gamma  times  B subscript 0
or in Hz:
f subscript 0  equals   open parenthesis gamma  divided by  2 times pi close parenthesis   times  B subscript 0

For protons at 1.5 Tesla:
f subscript 0  equals  42.58 MHz divided by T  times  1.5 T approx 63.87 MHz.

11.4 RF EXCITATION

To measure the magnetization, we must perturb it from equilibrium. We apply a Radio Frequency  open parenthesis RF close parenthesis  pulse  open parenthesis B subscript 1 field close parenthesis  oscillating at the Larmor frequency.
- This creates a condition of resonance.
- Energy is transferred to the spins, flipping some from low to high energy states.
- The net magnetization vector M tips away from the z-axis into the transverse  open parenthesis xy close parenthesis  plane.
- M precessing in the xy plane induces a voltage in a receiver coil  open parenthesis the MR signal close parenthesis .

11.5 RELAXATION  open parenthesis T1, T2 close parenthesis

After the RF pulse is turned off, the system returns to equilibrium. This process is called relaxation.

T1 Relaxation  open parenthesis Spin-Lattice Relaxation close parenthesis :
- The recovery of the longitudinal magnetization  open parenthesis M subscript z close parenthesis  along the z-axis.
- Energy is transferred from spins to the surrounding lattice  open parenthesis thermal motion close parenthesis .
- M subscript z open parenthesis t close parenthesis   equals  M subscript 0  times   open parenthesis 1 - e to the power of  open parenthesis -t divided by T1 close parenthesis  close parenthesis

T2 Relaxation  open parenthesis Spin-Spin Relaxation close parenthesis :
- The decay of the transverse magnetization  open parenthesis M subscript xy close parenthesis .
- Caused by interactions between spins dephasing each other.
- M subscript xy open parenthesis t close parenthesis   equals  M subscript xy open parenthesis 0 close parenthesis   times  e to the power of  open parenthesis -t divided by T2 close parenthesis

Different tissues have different T1 and T2 values, providing the contrast in MRI images.

CHAPTER 12 -- WATER, RESONANCE, AND DIELECTRIC RESPONSE

Water is fundamental to biological physics and exhibits unique electromagnetic properties.

12.1 MOLECULAR DIPOLES

A water molecule  open parenthesis H2O close parenthesis  is polar. The oxygen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms, pulling electron density towards it.
- This creates a permanent electric dipole moment: a positive charge center near the hydrogens and a negative center near the oxygen.
- In liquid water, hydrogen bonds form a transient network between molecules.

12.2 ROTATIONAL MODES

Molecules can rotate. In the gas phase, these rotations are quantized. In the liquid phase, rotation is hindered by collisions and hydrogen bonding.
- The dipole moment allows the molecule to interact strongly with oscillating electric fields  open parenthesis like microwaves close parenthesis .
- The field exerts a torque, causing the molecule to rotate.

12.3 DIELECTRIC LOSS

When a dielectric material  open parenthesis like water close parenthesis  is placed in an alternating electric field, the dipoles attempt to align with the field.
- At low frequencies, dipoles align easily.
- At very high frequencies  open parenthesis optical close parenthesis , they cannot keep up.
- At microwave frequencies  open parenthesis e.g., 2.45 GHz close parenthesis , the rotation lags behind the field due to friction divided by viscosity.
- This lag  open parenthesis phase difference close parenthesis  creates "Dielectric Loss." Energy from the field is dissipated as heat  open parenthesis molecular kinetic energy close parenthesis . This is the principle of microwave ovens.

12.4 FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT ABSORPTION

The complex permittivity epsilon describes the material's response:
epsilon  equals  epsilon' - i  times  epsilon''
- epsilon'  open parenthesis real part close parenthesis  represents energy storage  open parenthesis polarization close parenthesis .
- epsilon''  open parenthesis imaginary part close parenthesis  represents energy loss  open parenthesis absorption close parenthesis .

The absorption peaks at the relaxation frequency of the water molecules  open parenthesis approx 20 GHz at room temperature close parenthesis , but is significant over a broad range including the GHz band.
This strong absorption by water is why radar and communications signals at certain frequencies are heavily attenuated by rain.

CHAPTER 13 -- SCATTERING AND INTERACTION TYPES

When particles or waves encounter matter, they can be scattered or absorbed.

13.1 ELASTIC SCATTERING

In elastic scattering, the kinetic energy of the system is conserved. The incident particle changes direction but does not lose energy to the internal states of the target.
- Rayleigh Scattering: Scattering of light by particles much smaller than the wavelength  open parenthesis e.g., blue sky caused by air molecules close parenthesis . Scattering intensity is proportional to 1  divided by  lambda to the power of 4.
- Thomson Scattering: Low-energy photon scattering off a free electron.

13.2 INELASTIC SCATTERING

In inelastic scattering, kinetic energy is not conserved. Energy is transferred between the incident particle and the internal energy of the target.
- Compton Scattering: A photon collides with an electron, transferring energy to it. The scattered photon has a longer wavelength.
  Delta subscript lambda  equals   open parenthesis h  divided by  m subscript e  times  c close parenthesis   times   open parenthesis 1 - cos open parenthesis theta close parenthesis  close parenthesis
- Raman Scattering: Scattering of photons by molecules where the photon gains or loses energy corresponding to vibrational divided by rotational transitions.

13.3 ENERGY TRANSFER MECHANISMS

- Photoelectric Effect: A photon is completely absorbed by an atom, ejecting an electron. Dominant at low photon energies.
- Pair Production: A high-energy photon  open parenthesis  is greater than  1.022 MeV close parenthesis  interacts with a nucleus and converts into an electron-positron pair.

13.4 RADAR REFLECTION VS ABSORPTION

In radar systems:
- Reflection: Conductive surfaces  open parenthesis metals close parenthesis  reflect EM waves efficiently. The skin depth is small, so the wave essentially bounces off.
- Absorption: Stealth technology uses materials  open parenthesis Radar Absorbent Material - RAM close parenthesis  that absorb the incoming wave energy  open parenthesis via dielectric or magnetic loss close parenthesis  rather than reflecting it back to the source.
- Scattering Geometry: Shape also matters. Faceted surfaces deflect waves away from the receiver.

CHAPTER 14 -- STATISTICAL  and  THERMAL PHYSICS

Statistical physics bridges the gap between the microscopic behavior of particles and the macroscopic properties of materials  open parenthesis thermodynamics close parenthesis .

14.1 THERMAL MOTION

At temperatures above absolute zero, atoms and molecules are in constant random motion.
- Translational Kinetic Energy: For an ideal gas, the average kinetic energy per molecule is:
  K subscript avg  equals   open parenthesis 3 divided by 2 close parenthesis   times  k subscript B  times  T
  where k subscript B is the Boltzmann constant  open parenthesis 1.38 x 10 to the power of -23 J divided by K close parenthesis  and T is temperature in Kelvin.
- Temperature is essentially a measure of this random kinetic energy.

14.2 BOLTZMANN DISTRIBUTIONS

For a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature T, the probability P subscript i of finding the system in a state with energy E subscript i is given by the Boltzmann distribution:
P subscript i is proportional to e to the power of  open parenthesis -E subscript i  divided by  k subscript B  times  T close parenthesis
or
N subscript i  divided by  N subscript total  equals   open parenthesis 1 divided by Z close parenthesis   times  e to the power of  open parenthesis -E subscript i  divided by  k subscript B  times  T close parenthesis
where Z is the partition function  open parenthesis sum over all states close parenthesis .

This implies that states with lower energy are more populated than states with higher energy.

14.3 RELAXATION TIMES

When a system is perturbed from equilibrium, it takes time to return to the thermal distribution.
- The "relaxation time"  open parenthesis tau close parenthesis  characterizes this rate.
- Rate of change is often proportional to the deviation from equilibrium.
  dX divided by dt  equals  - open parenthesis X - X subscript eq close parenthesis   divided by  tau
- This concept is central to NMR  open parenthesis T1 relaxation close parenthesis  and dielectric relaxation.

14.4 POPULATION DIFFERENCES

In many two-level systems  open parenthesis like spin states in NMR close parenthesis , the signal strength depends on the population difference between the lower  open parenthesis N plus  close parenthesis  and upper  open parenthesis N- close parenthesis  levels.
Ratio: N-  divided by  N plus   equals  e to the power of  open parenthesis -Delta subscript E  divided by  k subscript B  times  T close parenthesis
Since Delta subscript E is often small  open parenthesis for NMR close parenthesis , the ratio is very close to 1. The "excess" population in the lower state is what generates the net magnetization.
- At lower temperatures, the population difference increases, leading to stronger signals.
- At high temperatures, the populations equalize  open parenthesis saturation close parenthesis .

CHAPTER 15 -- MEASUREMENT, SIGNAL, AND NOISE

Experimental physics relies on detecting signals in the presence of noise.

15.1 SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO  open parenthesis SNR close parenthesis

SNR is the ratio of the power of the desired signal to the power of the background noise.
SNR  equals  P subscript signal  divided by  P subscript noise
Often expressed in decibels  open parenthesis dB close parenthesis :
SNR subscript dB  equals  10  times  log10 open parenthesis P subscript signal  divided by  P subscript noise close parenthesis

For voltage amplitudes:
SNR  equals  A subscript signal  divided by  A subscript noise
SNR subscript dB  equals  20  times  log10 open parenthesis A subscript signal  divided by  A subscript noise close parenthesis

Improving SNR:
- Signal Averaging: Summing N repeated measurements increases the signal by N, but noise  open parenthesis uncorrelated close parenthesis  increases by sqrt open parenthesis N close parenthesis . Thus, SNR improves by sqrt open parenthesis N close parenthesis .
- Bandwidth Reduction: Filtering out frequencies where the signal is not present reduces noise power.

15.2 DETECTION LIMITS

The detection limit is the smallest signal that can be reliably distinguished from noise  open parenthesis typically SNR  is greater than  3 close parenthesis .
- Factors limiting detection:
  - Thermal Noise  open parenthesis Johnson-Nyquist close parenthesis : V subscript noise  equals  sqrt open parenthesis 4  times  k subscript B  times  T  times  R  times  Delta subscript f close parenthesis . Generated by thermal agitation of electrons in conductors.
  - Shot Noise: Due to the discrete nature of charge carriers  open parenthesis photons or electrons close parenthesis .

15.3 SPECTROSCOPY

Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation as a function of wavelength or frequency.
- Absorption Spectroscopy: Measuring dip in intensity as light passes through a sample.
- Emission Spectroscopy: Measuring light emitted by excited atoms.

15.4 LINE BROADENING

Spectral lines are not infinitely sharp; they have a finite width.
Mechanisms:
1. Natural Broadening: Due to the uncertainty principle  open parenthesis Delta subscript E  times  Delta subscript t  is greater than  equals  h subscript bar divided by 2 close parenthesis . Short-lived states have broad energy uncertainties.
2. Doppler Broadening: Thermal motion of atoms causes Doppler shifts, widening the observed line distribution.
3. Pressure divided by Collisional Broadening: Collisions interrupt the emission process, effectively shortening the lifetime of the state.
4. Inhomogeneous Broadening: Variations in the local environment  open parenthesis e.g., magnetic field inhomogeneities in NMR close parenthesis  cause different parts of the sample to resonate at slightly different frequencies.
