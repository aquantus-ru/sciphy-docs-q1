# Chapter 15: Measurement, Signal, and Noise

## 15.1 Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)

The fundamental limit of any measurement is noise.
$$ SNR = \frac{P_{signal}}{P_{noise}} = \frac{A_{signal}^2}{A_{noise}^2} $$
In decibels:
$$ SNR_{dB} = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{P_{sig}}{P_{noise}} \right) = 20 \log_{10} \left( \frac{A_{sig}}{A_{noise}} \right) $$

## 15.2 Sources of Noise

1.  **Johnson-Nyquist (Thermal) Noise:**
    Caused by thermal agitation of charge carriers.
    $$ V_{RMS} = \sqrt{4 k_B T R \Delta f} $$
    *   $R$: Resistance.
    *   $\Delta f$: Bandwidth.
    *   Reduce by cooling ($T \downarrow$) or narrowing bandwidth ($\Delta f \downarrow$).
2.  **Shot Noise:**
    Due to discrete nature of current ($I$). Poisson process.
    $$ I_{noise} = \sqrt{2 e I \Delta f} $$
3.  **1/f Noise (Pink Noise):**
    Dominant at low frequencies. Source often specific to materials/interfaces.

## 15.3 Signal Processing

### Signal Averaging
If noise is random (zero mean), adding $N$ scans sums signal linearly ($N \times S$) but noise incoherently ($\sqrt{N} \times \sigma$).
$$ SNR_N = \frac{N S}{\sqrt{N} \sigma} = \sqrt{N} \, SNR_1 $$

### The Fourier Transform (FT)
Decomposes a time-domain signal $f(t)$ into frequency components $F(\omega)$.
$$ F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t) e^{-i\omega t} dt $$
Crucial for Spectroscopy and MRI (converting time signal to spatial image).

**Sampling Theorem (Nyquist-Shannon):**
To perfectly reconstruct a signal with max frequency $f_{max}$, one must sample at rate $f_s$:
$$ f_s \ge 2 f_{max} $$
Failing to do so results in **Aliasing** (high frequencies masquerading as low ones).

## 15.4 Spectral Line Broadening

Real signals (spectral lines) have finite width $\Gamma$.

1.  **Homogeneous Broadening (Lorentzian):** Same for all emitters (e.g., Natural lifetime broadening).
    $$ L(\omega) \propto \frac{1}{(\omega - \omega_0)^2 + (\Gamma/2)^2} $$
    FT of an exponential decay ($e^{-t/T_2}$).
2.  **Inhomogeneous Broadening (Gaussian):** Distribution of center frequencies (e.g., Doppler shift, magnetic field inhomogeneity).
    $$ G(\omega) \propto e^{-(\omega - \omega_0)^2 / 2\sigma^2} $$

## Dictionary of Terms

*   **Aliasing:** An effect that causes different signals to become indistinguishable (or aliases of one another) when sampled.
*   **Bandwidth:** The difference between the upper and lower frequencies in a continuous band of frequencies.
*   **Decibel (dB):** A logarithmic unit used to express the ratio of two values of a physical quantity, often power or intensity.
*   **Fourier Transform:** A mathematical transform that decomposes a function (often a function of time, or a signal) into its constituent frequencies.
*   **Johnson Noise:** The electronic noise generated by the thermal agitation of the charge carriers (usually the electrons) inside an electrical conductor at equilibrium.
*   **Nyquist Rate:** The minimum rate at which a signal can be sampled without introducing errors, which is twice the highest frequency present in the signal.
*   **Shot Noise:** Noise caused by the discrete nature of electric charge.
*   **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):** A measure used in science and engineering that compares the level of a desired signal to the level of background noise.
*   **Spectral Line:** A dark or bright line in an otherwise uniform and continuous spectrum, resulting from emission or absorption of light in a narrow frequency range.
