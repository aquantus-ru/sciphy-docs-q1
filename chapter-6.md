# Chapter 6: Classical Electromagnetism

## 6.1 Electric Fields and Gauss's Law

### Coulomb's Law
The electrostatic force between two point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$:
$$ \vec{F} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \hat{r} $$
where $k_e = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$.

### The Electric Field
Defined as force per unit charge: $\vec{E} = \vec{F}/q$.
For a point charge $Q$:
$$ \vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{Q}{r^2} \hat{r} $$

### Gauss's Law
A powerful tool for calculating fields of symmetric charge distributions. The total electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge.
$$ \oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0} $$

*   **Example (Sphere):** For a charged sphere of radius $R$, draw a Gaussian sphere of radius $r > R$. Symmetry implies $E$ is constant and radial.
    $$ E (4\pi r^2) = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0} \implies E = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r^2} $$
    Behaves like a point charge.

## 6.2 Magnetic Fields

Magnetic fields ($\vec{B}$) are produced by moving charges (currents).

### Lorentz Force Law
A particle with charge $q$ moving with velocity $\vec{v}$ in fields $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ experiences a force:
$$ \vec{F} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B}) $$
*   Magnetic force is always perpendicular to velocity, so it does **no work**.
*   Causes circular motion for charges entering $\vec{B}$ perpendicularly ($r = mv/qB$).

### Biot-Savart Law
Calculates $\vec{B}$ generated by a current element $I d\vec{l}$:
$$ d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi} \frac{d\vec{l} \times \hat{r}}{r^2} $$

## 6.3 Maxwell's Equations

These four equations form the foundation of classical electrodynamics.

1.  **Gauss's Law (E):** $\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$
    *   Charges create divergence in E-fields.
2.  **Gauss's Law (B):** $\nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0$
    *   No magnetic monopoles; B-field lines form closed loops.
3.  **Faraday's Law:** $\nabla \times \vec{E} = - \frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}$
    *   Changing magnetic fields induce electric fields (basis of generators).
4.  **Ampere-Maxwell Law:** $\nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \vec{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t}$
    *   Magnetic fields are created by currents and changing electric fields.

## 6.4 Electromagnetic Waves

In vacuum ($\rho=0, J=0$), Maxwell's equations decouple into wave equations:
$$ \nabla^2 \vec{E} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \vec{E}}{\partial t^2} $$
This predicts waves traveling at speed:
$$ c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}} \approx 3.00 \times 10^8 \, m/s $$
Light is an electromagnetic wave. $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ oscillate in phase, perpendicular to each other and the direction of propagation ($\vec{k}$).
