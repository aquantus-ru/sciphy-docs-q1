# Chapter 7: Matter, Atoms, and Isotopes

## 7.1 Atomic Structure

The atom consists of a nucleus (protons + neutrons) surrounded by electrons.

### The Bohr Model (Semi-Classical)
Electrons orbit in quantized shells. Angular momentum is quantized:
$$ L = n\hbar $$
Energy levels for Hydrogen:
$$ E_n = - \frac{13.6 \, eV}{n^2} $$
Light is emitted/absorbed when jumping levels: $h f = E_f - E_i$.

### Quantum Mechanical Model
Electrons are described by orbitals (probability clouds), characterized by four quantum numbers:
1.  **Principal ($n$):** Energy level ($1, 2, 3...$).
2.  **Azimuthal ($l$):** Orbital shape ($0$ to $n-1$; s, p, d, f).
3.  **Magnetic ($m_l$):** Orientation ($-l$ to $+l$).
4.  **Spin ($m_s$):** Electron spin ($\pm 1/2$).

**Pauli Exclusion Principle:** No two fermions (electrons) can occupy the same quantum state.

## 7.2 Nuclear Composition

*   **Proton ($p$):** Charge $+e$, mass $1.007276\,u$.
*   **Neutron ($n$):** Charge $0$, mass $1.008665\,u$.
*   **Atomic Number ($Z$):** Number of protons. Defines the element.
*   **Mass Number ($A$):** $Z + N$.

## 7.3 Isotopes

Isotopes are nuclides with the same $Z$ but different $N$.
*   Chemical properties (determined by electrons) are identical.
*   Physical properties (mass, stability) differ.

**Example: Hydrogen Isotopes**
*   Protium ($^1H$): 1p, 0n. Stable (99.98%).
*   Deuterium ($^2H$ or D): 1p, 1n. Stable (0.015%).
*   Tritium ($^3H$ or T): 1p, 2n. Unstable ($t_{1/2} \approx 12.3$ yrs).

## 7.4 Binding Energy and Mass Defect

The mass of a nucleus is *less* than the sum of its parts.
$$ \Delta m = (Z m_p + N m_n) - m_{nucleus} $$
This missing mass is the **Binding Energy** ($BE$) holding the nucleus together:
$$ BE = \Delta m c^2 $$

### Binding Energy per Nucleon
Plotting $BE/A$ vs $A$ shows a curve peaking near Iron-56 ($Fe$).
*   **Fusion:** Light nuclei combine to move up the curve (releasing energy).
*   **Fission:** Heavy nuclei split to move up the curve (releasing energy).

## Dictionary of Terms

*   **Atomic Mass Unit ($u$):** $1/12$ of the mass of a carbon-12 atom ($\approx 1.66 \times 10^{-27}$ kg).
*   **Binding Energy:** The energy that would be required to disassemble the nucleus of an atom into its component protons and neutrons.
*   **Isotope:** Variants of a particular chemical element which differ in neutron number.
*   **Mass Defect:** The difference between the mass of an isotope and its mass number.
*   **Nucleon:** A proton or a neutron.
*   **Orbital:** A mathematical function that describes the wave-like behavior of an electron in an atom.
*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** A quantum mechanical principle which states that two or more identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.
*   **Photon:** A quantum of electromagnetic radiation.
*   **Quantization:** The procedure of constraining a physical quantity to discrete values.
*   **Valence Electron:** An electron in the outer shell of an atom which can participate in the formation of a chemical bond.
