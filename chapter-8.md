# Chapter 8: Nuclear Physics

## 8.1 Nuclear Forces

The nucleus is a battleground between two forces:
1.  **Electrostatic Force:** Long-range repulsion between protons. Tries to tear the nucleus apart.
2.  **Strong Nuclear Force:** Short-range ($\approx 1\,fm$) attraction between nucleons. Holds the nucleus together.

For stable nuclei, the strong force overcomes the electric force. As $Z$ increases, more neutrons are needed to provide extra "glue" without extra charge repulsion.

## 8.2 Radioactivity

Unstable nuclei decay to reach a lower energy state.
The decay rate is proportional to the number of nuclei $N$:
$$ \frac{dN}{dt} = -\lambda N $$
Solution:
$$ N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t} $$

**Half-Life ($t_{1/2}$):** Time for $N$ to drop to $N_0/2$.
$$ t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{\lambda} \approx \frac{0.693}{\lambda} $$
**Activity ($A$):** Decays per second ($A = \lambda N$). Unit: Becquerel ($Bq$).

## 8.3 Decay Modes

### Alpha Decay ($\alpha$)
Emission of a Helium nucleus ($^4_2He$). Common in heavy elements.
$$ ^A_Z X \rightarrow ^{A-4}_{Z-2} Y + \alpha $$
Mechanism: Quantum Tunneling. The $\alpha$ particle tunnels through the potential barrier of the nucleus.

### Beta Decay ($\beta^-$)
Neutron turns into proton + electron + antineutrino.
$$ n \rightarrow p + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e $$
$$ ^A_Z X \rightarrow ^A_{Z+1} Y + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e $$
Occurs in neutron-rich nuclei. Weak interaction process.

### Beta Plus Decay ($\beta^+$)
Proton turns into neutron + positron + neutrino.
$$ p \rightarrow n + e^+ + \nu_e $$
$$ ^A_Z X \rightarrow ^A_{Z-1} Y + e^+ + \nu_e $$

### Gamma Decay ($\gamma$)
Emission of high-energy photon from an excited nucleus.
$$ ^A_Z X^* \rightarrow ^A_Z X + \gamma $$

## 8.4 Interaction of Radiation with Matter

*   **Alpha:** High ionization, low penetration (stopped by paper).
*   **Beta:** Moderate ionization, moderate penetration (stopped by aluminum).
*   **Gamma:** Low ionization, high penetration (requires lead shielding).
