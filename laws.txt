FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS LAWS

3.1 Newton's Laws of Motion
Dynamics connects motion to its causes (forces).

--------------------
1. Newton's First Law (Inertia)
A body continues in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by a net external force. *   **Inertia:** The resistance of an object to changes in its motion. Mass is the quantitative measure of inertia.

--------------------
2. Newton's Second Law
The rate of change of momentum is proportional to the applied force. $$ \vec{F}_{net} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} $$ For constant mass, $\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$, so: $$ \vec{F}_{net} = m \vec{a} $$ This is a vector equation: $\sum F_x = ma_x$, $\sum F_y = ma_y$.

--------------------
3. Newton's Third Law
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. $$ \vec{F}_{AB} = - \vec{F}_{BA} $$ *   Forces always exist in pairs. *   Action and reaction forces act on **different** objects.

--------------------
4.2 Kinetic Energy and the Work-Energy Theorem
**Kinetic Energy ($K$)** is the energy of motion: $$ K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 $$ **Work-Energy Theorem:** The net work done on an object equals the change in its kinetic energy. $$ W_{net} = \Delta K = K_f - K_i $$ *Proof (1D):*

--------------------
Coulomb's Law
The electrostatic force between two point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$: $$ \vec{F} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \hat{r} $$ where $k_e = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$.

--------------------
Gauss's Law
A powerful tool for calculating fields of symmetric charge distributions. The total electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge. $$ \oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0} $$ *   **Example (Sphere):** For a charged sphere of radius $R$, draw a Gaussian sphere of radius $r > R$. Symmetry implies $E$ is constant and radial. $$ E (4\pi r^2) = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0} \implies E = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r^2} $$ Behaves like a point charge.

--------------------
Lorentz Force Law
A particle with charge $q$ moving with velocity $\vec{v}$ in fields $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ experiences a force: $$ \vec{F} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B}) $$ *   Magnetic force is always perpendicular to velocity, so it does **no work**. *   Causes circular motion for charges entering $\vec{B}$ perpendicularly ($r = mv/qB$).

--------------------
Biot-Savart Law
Calculates $\vec{B}$ generated by a current element $I d\vec{l}$: $$ d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi} \frac{d\vec{l} \times \hat{r}}{r^2} $$
